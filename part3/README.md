Part 3 consists of a Vue-ified version of part 2, complete with a REST api backend which needs connecting

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

# Tasks:

## Adapt the code to use the backend api for the following:

* Adding a task
* Marking a task as done
* Deleting tasks

## New features to implement:

* Sort the list by any field
* Get only the tasks assigned to a specific person
* Category of the tasks

Note that implementing all of these is not required or expected! Pick as many as you would like, to demonstrate your coding ability.

# Bonus additions:

* Add basic responsive support for sensible operation on a smart phone 
* Improve design & feel to your own discretion - have some fun with it and impart some of your own style!
* Add unit tests to cover some functionality
